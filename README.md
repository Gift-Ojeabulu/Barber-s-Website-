# Barber-s-Website 
I built a front end  website from scratch with HTML,CSS and Javascript which I deployed on Netlify.

A personal project I worked on called Oscar's Barbing Salon.

The goal of the project was to make locating a barbing salon in the subject area so easy and to reduce unnnecessary queuing/waiting time of customer's in the barbing salon.
